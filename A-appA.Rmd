The figure below shows violin plots for four variables across Census years, providing a snapshot of the variables recorded for each year.

```{r vis-census1, fig.cap="Census derived metrics"}

       aes(x=year, y=value, fill=year)) + geom_violin() + facet_wrap(~measure, scales = "free_y") + theme(text=element_text(size=7), axis.text.x=element_text(size=6), axis.text.y=element_text(size=6)) + labs(x = "Year", y = "Metric (%)")
```

```{r vis-census2, fig.cap="Census derived metrics"}

# Transformation methods for logratio analysis
Denote the vector holding votes for each party $j \in {1,...,D}$ in electorate $i$ as:
$$\bm{v}_i = (v_{i1},v_{i2},...,v_{iD})$$
where $\sum_{j=1}^D v_{ij} = 1$

### Additive Logratio {-}

Maps to $\mathbb{R}^{D} \text{ for } \bm{v}_i \to \bm{w}_i$
$$
  \text{alr}(v_{ij}) = w_{ij} = \text{ln}(v_{ij}/v_{iD}), \space \forall \space j \in \{1,\dots,D\}
$$
$$
  \text{alr}(\bm{v}_i) = (\frac{\text{ln}(v_{i1})}{\text{ln}(v_{iD})}, \dots, \frac{\text{ln}(v_{i(D-1)})}{\text{ln}(v_{iD})}, 1) = \text{ln}(\bm{v}_i) \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & \dots & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & \dots & 1 \\
    -1 & -1 & \dots & -1
  \end{bmatrix}
$$
Transform back to $\bm{v}_i$ using
: $\bm{v}_i = \exp(\bm{w}_i) \cdot v_{iD}$

### Centred Logratio {-}

Maps to $\mathbb{R}^{D} \text{ for } \bm{v}_i \to \bm{w}_i$. Let $g(\bm{v}_i) = \sqrt[D]{\prod_{j=1}^D v_{ij}}$.
$$
  \text{clr}(v_{ij}) = w_{ij} = \text{ln}(\frac{v_{ij}}{g(\bm{v}_i)}), \forall \space j \in \{1,\dots,D\}
$$
$$
  \text{clr}(\bm{v}_i) = \Big(\text{ln}(\frac{v_{i1}}{g(\bm{v}_i)}),\dots,\text{ln}(\frac{v_{iD}}{g(\bm{v}_i)}))\Big) \\ = \frac{\text{ln}(\bm{x}_i)}{D} \cdot
   \begin{bmatrix}
     D-1 & -1 & \dots & -1 \\
     -1 & D-1 & \dots & -1 \\
     \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
     -1 & -1 & \dots & D-1
   \end{bmatrix}
$$
Transform back to $\bm{v}_i$ using
: $v_{ij} = \frac{\exp(w_{ij})}{\sum_{j=1}^D \exp(w_{ij})}$

### Isometric Logratio {-}

Maps to $\mathbb{R}^{D-1} \text{ for } \bm{v}_i \to \bm{w}_i$.
$$
  \text{ilr}_M(\bm{v}_i) = clr(\bm{v}_i)\cdot\bm{M} = \text{ln}(\bm{v}_i) \cdot \bm{M},
$$
where $\bm{M}$ is a matrix of $D$ rows and $D-1$ columns such that $\bm{M} \cdot \bm{M}^t = \bm{I}_{D-1}$. $\bm{I}_{D-1}$ is the identity matrix of $D-1$ elements.
Transform back to $\bm{v}_i$ as
: $\bm{v}_i = \exp(\bm{w}_i \space \cdot \space {\bm{M}^{-1}})$
