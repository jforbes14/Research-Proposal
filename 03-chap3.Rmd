# Data {#ch:Data}

The two main data sources for this research are the Australian Census of Population and Housing from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), and published federal election results from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).

The Census of Population and Housing collects data on the key characteristics of every Australian, and is conducted every five years. There have been four censuses in the 21st century, being that in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. The information contained in these collections are used to build the socio-demographic profiles for each electorate.

Federal elections typically occur every three years, and the those of interest are the 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016 elections. All information from these sources are publicly available.

## Electorates and their boundaries

Australian Federal elections are determined based on which party wins a majority of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives, with each seat corresponding to an electorate. The electorate boundaries are determined by population, and to ensure equal representation, the boundaries of these divisions have to be redrawn regularly by the AEC. Each redistribution typically affects a handful of electorates, with most remaining the same as previously defined.

Since changes are continually made to electoral boundaries, when it is time for a Census to be conducted, the ABS constructs an approximation to the current electorates and aggregates data at this level.

What this means is that the electorate boundaries in the election prior to a Census may not match the boundaries used in the Census, which may not match the boundaries in the following election and so on.

This presents a challenge. How does one construct socio-demographic profiles at election time for each electorate, when we cannot directly match that election with a censuses?


## Censuses

### Collection

Data for each Census are downloaded as a collection of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, with each spreadsheet corresponding to a particular electorate, or a particular question (depending on the format used in that Census year).

In order to convert the information held in these spreadsheets into a summarised table containing selected socio-demographics for each electorate, a series of R scripts and Rmarkdown files have been created. The output of each file is an R `data.frame` object, which tabulates the selected metrics for that Census year.

There was no way to automate this process, and the formats of each Census collection change slightly each year. As such, it has taken a significant amount of time and effort to extract the information from excel, and wrangle the data into the desired metrics and format. A snippet of the raw data can be found in the appendix \@ref(fig:excel-demo).

The resultant data.frame for each election contains information for each electorate on:

- State
- Population
- Age
- Education
- Employment
- Religious and cultural identity
- Median incomes (personal, household, family)
- Median rent and loan payments
- Citizenship and birthplace
- Language at home
- Relationship status

All metrics are recorded as percentages, representing the percentage of people in that electorate who satisfy the category in question. For example, $AusCitizen$ is the percentage of people in the electorate who are Australian citizens.

A full description of socio-demographic variables in the electorate profiles can be found in the appendix \@ref(ch:appendix).


### Insights on the changing Australian demographic

Comparing Census data across years reveals many insights into how the Australian demographic has changed over the past 17 years. By examining visual distributions of metrics across Census years, trends can be identified for the entire country and for the spread amongst electorates.

#### As Australians grow old, some stay young

It is well documented that Australia has an ageing population, and this is reflected in the MedianAge plot (Figure \@ref(fig:vis-age)), as we see the distribution of median age across electorates spread upwards, with some electorates in 2016 having a median age of 50 years old. However, some electorates are not ageing as others do, which makes intuitive sense, because some areas may be more suitable for particular age brackets.

This is exactly the effect we see in young adults. Those aged 25--34 are more likely to congregate in common electorates, and avoid other electorates than they were in 2001 - making up 35% of the population in some electorates.

```{r vis-age, fig.asp = 0.2, fig.cap="Age profile of Australian electorates"}
vis_age <- vis_df %>%
  filter(measure %in% c("Age15_19", "Age25_34", "Age55_64", "MedianAge"))

ggplot(vis_age, aes(x=year, y=value, fill=year)) + geom_violin() + facet_wrap(~measure, scales = "free_y", nrow = 1) + labs(x = "Census year", y = "% of electorate population") + theme(text=element_text(size=8), axis.text.x=element_text(size=6), axis.text.y=element_text(size=8))
```

#### Religion: a thing of the past?

Socially "progressive" movements continue to gather momentum all over the world, and as a result, Australia is moving away from traditional religious beliefs and values. The frequency of individuals not identifying with a religion has grown significantly over the years. This effect has stretched across (what appears to be) every electorate (Figure \@ref(fig:vis-relig)). Having a religious identity of any kind would make you a minority in some electorates! At the same time, particular electorates maintain large representation of a particular religious group, as seen by thin upper tails of the Buddhism, Islam and Judaism metrics.

```{r vis-relig, fig.asp = 0.2, fig.cap="Religious profile of Australian electorates"}
vis_relig <- vis_df %>%
  filter(measure %in% c("NoReligion", "Christianity", "Islam", "Judaism"))

ggplot(vis_relig, aes(x=year, y=value, fill=year)) + geom_violin() + facet_wrap(~measure, scales = "free_y", nrow = 1) + labs(x = "Census year", y = "% of electorate population") + theme(text=element_text(size=8), axis.text.x=element_text(size=6), axis.text.y=element_text(size=8))
```


#### Investing in education

Australia has seen improvements in education outcomes across the board, experiencing continual increases in secondary and tertiary competion rates across the years (Figure \@ref(fig:vis-educ)). It is encouraging to see that no electorates appear to be lagging behind, as the minimum values increase each year for all levels of education.

```{r vis-educ, fig.asp = 0.2, fig.cap="Education profile of Australian electorates"}
vis_educ <- vis_df %>%
  filter(measure %in% c("HighSchool", "Bachelor", "Postgraduate", "CurrentlyStudying"))

ggplot(vis_educ, aes(x=year, y=value, fill=year)) + geom_violin() + facet_wrap(~measure, scales = "free_y", nrow = 1) + labs(x = "Census year", y = "% of electorate population") + theme(text=element_text(size=8),axis.text.x=element_text(size=6),axis.text.y=element_text(size=8))
```


Violin plots of the complete set of variables in the electorate profiles can be found in the appendix, see \@ref(fig:vis-census).

##### A note on Census non-response

Like in any survey, non-response bias is a source of potential problems. ABS statements released with each Census assure a high quality of data collection, and this study assumes its reliability.

Non-response for key variables is imputed by the ABS (age, sex, martial status and usual residence) for 2006, 2011 and 2016, although is not clear whether this has been done in 2001. Non imputed items are treated as "not stated" or "not applicable", dependent on the imputed age of the person.

No adjustments or imputations are made in this study to the values derived from each Census. However, the frequency of "not stated" responses will be recorded for particular questions, and are included with other Census-derived metrics in the electorate profiles.


## Elections

Within each electorate, candidates from various political parties will run for election to represent that electorate. Voting is compulsory in Australia, and the winning candidate is determined by preferential voting. This means that each person assigns a numbered preference to each candidate, and the winner is determined by receiving a majority of preference votes.

At the end of tallying the first round of preferences, if there is no majority, the party with the least votes will have its first preference vote distributed to the parties that voters had selected as their second preference. This is continued until a party receives an absolute majority of votes.

The three type of vote counts are published for each federal election, they are as follows.

- Division of preferences: distribution of preferences at each step of reallocation, beginning with first preferences.
- Two party preferred: distribution of preferences where, by convention, comparisons are made between the ALP and the leading Liberal/National candidates.
- Two candidate preffered: distribution of preferences to the two candidates who came first and second in the election.

For this study, the two party preferred and division of preferences outcomes are used to answer research questions (1), (2) and (3).

These can be downloaded directly from the AEC website, and have been compiled and stored in $R$ data.frames, using the same method as described for the Census data.

## Mapping socio-demographic profiles to election times

The elections and censuses have different frequencies, occuring every three and five years respectively. This naturally leads to a significant challenge in conducting socio-political analysis over time, mapping...

- A Census to an election that fall on the same year

- Census information to an election that does not fall on a Census year

```{r, fig.cap="Timeline of Australian elections and censuses", out.height="30%", fig.align="center"}
timeline <- data.frame(year = c(2001:2016)) %>%
  mutate(election = ifelse(year %in% c(2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016),1,0),
         census = ifelse(year %in% c(2001, 2006, 2011, 2016), 1.4, 0)) %>%
  gather(c(election,census), key = event, value = measure) %>%  filter(measure != 0) %>%
  mutate(year_vis = ifelse(event == "census", year + 0.1, year))

```

### Elections that fall on a Census year

When a Census is conducted in an election year the electorate boundaries used by the ABS match the AEC electoral divisions for that election, so the Census profiles for each electorate can be directly mapped to the election time. This is done by joining information from the 2001 and 2016 data.frames.

### Elections that do not fall on a Census year

If the election does not fall on the same year a Census is conducted, two problems arise:

- Electorate boundaries may not match any of the neighbouring censuses
- Demographics may have changed since the last Census was conducted

This study proposes an innovative projection algorithm using GIS maps, $k$-centroid mapping, for imputing the demographic profiles for each election, accounting for both the time of the election and the boundaries in place. The use of GIS maps to overlay data from multiple sources is a dominant approach in spatial studies, which provides the foundation for $k$-centroid mapping.

## K-centroid mapping

For the purpose of illustrating the algorithm, "division" will be used instead of "electorate".

$k$-centroid mapping is a method of imputing Census demographics for divisions in place at the time of an election. Using tools predominantly from the *rgeos* package, each boundary at election time is superimposed on top of the divisions at a particular Census time to determine which of the Census divisions intersect with the superimposed boundary. For each division that intersects the boundary, its area of intersection with the superimposed boundary is computed. These areas are used to impute the composition of the population that sit within the election boundary, where each person is categorised by their Census division. A weighted average of demographics from the Census divisions is then used to impute the socio-demographic profile of the election boundary. This is done for each of the election divisions, and the process repeats for the other Census. Interpolating between the two censuses, based on time, yields the final imputed profiles.

The $k$-centroid mapping algorithm for imputing the socio-demographic profiles for divisions defined at the time of an election is as follows:

1. Select the nearest censuses that occur before and after election time. To map the 2013 Federal election profiles, we would select the censuses from 2011 and 2016.

2. Simplify the GIS maps for the division boundaries for each Census, and the election.

Using `gSimplify()` from the *rgeos* package, we reduce the size of the maps (by reducing the number of points) to reduce computational burden. This step is not necessary but helps the processing of large maps.

3. For each map, calculate the centroid of each division.

Centroids for each polygon (division) are defined as using Euclidean distance.

4. Select an election division and create a map containing Census divisions with $k$ closest centroids to the election division.

Now consider only the division "Brisbane" in the 2013 election. The polygon for its boundaries is shown in \@ref(fig:bris-k3) by the dotted blue line, with the boundaries of the closest $k = 3$ divisions at the time of the 2011 Census shown in red.

Note: $k = 3$ is chosen here to illustrate how the algorithm functions. The selection of $k$ depends on the properties of the two maps. We see here that $k = 3$ is a sufficient choice, because there do not appear to be parts of the 2013 division that sit outside of the 3 nearest divisions, but this may not be the case for other 2013 divisions. For this study, $k=35$ is chosen due to the variation in sizes of the divisions, as a neighbouring division can be very large and have a distant centroid.

```{r bris-k3, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Brisbane and the k=3 closest divisions.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
plot(cens_bris_poly, border = rgb(1, .1, .1), lty=1, lwd=1, ylim = c(-27.53, -27.28), xlim = c(153,153.102)) +
  plot(cens_grif_poly, border = rgb(1, .1, .1), lty=1, lwd=1, add = TRUE) +
  plot(cens_lill_poly, border = rgb(1, .1, .1), lty=1, lwd=1, add = TRUE) +
  plot(elec_poly, border = rgb(0, 0, 1, 1), lty = 2, lwd=2, add = TRUE) + box() -> junk
```


5. For each of the $k$ closest Census divisions, determine the area of intersection with the election division.

Continuing with Brisbane from 2013, we see the area of overlap each of Brisbane, Griffith and Lilley from the 2011 boundaries, given by the shaded blue region (Figure \@ref(fig:bris-ints)).

In general, this would be done between the Brisbane (2013) and every one of its $k$ nearest 2011 divisions.

```{r bris-ints, fig.align='left', out.width="100%", out.height="28%", fig.cap="Intersection of Brisbane (2013) and nearby Census divisions (2011)"}
knitr::include_graphics("data/Brisbane-Intersect.jpeg")
```

6. Calculate the number of people each intersect represents.

We see that the shaded intersection areas are only a piece of their 2011 Census division. The population of Lilley (2011) is
$145,652$, and the intersection with Brisbane (2013) is approximately $2.22\%$ of the total area in Lilley, so the population captured by the shaded area is $3,233$. Here we assume population is equally spread throughout each division.

$$PopulationInt_{Lill} = \frac{Area_{intersect}}{Area_{Lill}} \cdot Population_{Lill} = 0.222 \cdot 145,652 \approx 3233$$

The intersection of Brisbane and Brisbane equates to 99.00% of the 2011 Brisbane division. Brisbane (2011) has a population of $145,051$, so intersection represents approximately $143,602$ people. There is no overlap with Griffith (2011).

7. Determine the socio-demographic profile based on the people in each intersection, where each person assumes the demographic composition of their Census division.

Brisbane (election, 2013) is made up of $143,602$ people from Brisbane (Census, 2011) and $3,233$ people from Lilley (Census, 2011). To impute each socio-demographic statistic for the Brisbane division (2013), we take a weighted average of the Census demographics, using the intersection populations, $PopulationInt$, used as the weights.

For example, estimating $AusCitizen$ for the superimposed Brisbane (2013) election boundary is done by a weighted average of its intersection with Lilley and Brisbane.
$$\hat{AusCitizen_{Bris,Election}} = \frac{AusCitizen_{Bris,Census} \cdot PopulationInt_{Bris} + AusCitizen_{Lill,Census} \cdot PopulationInt_{Lill}}{PopulationInt_{Bris} + PopulationInt_{Lill}}$$

8. Repeat steps 4-7 for each election division.

9. Interpolate between the Censuses by year to impute the socio-demographic division profile for the election year.

The 2013 election sits two years after the 2011 Census, and three years before the 2016 Census. Take a weighted average of each demographic across time points for each division.
$$\hat{AusCitizen_{Bris,Election,2013}} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \hat{AusCitizen_{Bris,Election,2011}} + \frac{3}{5} \cdot \hat{AusCitizen_{Bris,Election,2016}}$$
